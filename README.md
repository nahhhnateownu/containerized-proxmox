# Proxmox VE and Datacenter Manager inside container
Proxmox cluster in Docker. Learn, test, break, repeat.

- **Fast iteration** — Spin up, tear down, repeat in seconds
- **Cluster simulation** — Test HA, failover, and live migration
- **Automation testing** — Validate Terraform, Ansible, or scripts
- **Shared storage** — Mount ISOs, backups, disk images volume across nodes
- **KVM and LXC** — Work out of the box

---

## Requirements

- A modern Linux host with kernel 6.8+
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- CPU with virtualization support (Intel VT-x / AMD-V)

---

## Quick Start
Standalone node with `docker run`:
```bash
docker run -d --name pve-1 --hostname pve-1 \
    -p 2222:22 -p 3128:3128 -p 8006:8006 \
    --restart unless-stopped  \
    --privileged --cgroupns=host -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup \
    -v /dev/vfio:/dev/vfio \
    -v /usr/lib/modules:/usr/lib/modules:ro \
    -v /sys/kernel/security:/sys/kernel/security \
    -v ./VM-Backup:/var/lib/vz/dump \
    -v ./ISOs:/var/lib/vz/template/iso \
    ghcr.io/longqt-sea/proxmox-ve
```
Replace `./ISOs` with the path to your ISO folder.

Set root password and restart the container at least once:
```
docker exec -it pve-1 passwd
docker restart pve-1
```

Access the web UI at `https://localhost:8006` (accept the self-signed cert).

## Multi-Node Cluster with Docker Compose (recommended)
A 3-node HA cluster sharing ISOs and backups setup:
```
mkdir pve_cluster && cd pve_cluster

nano docker-compose.yml
```
Paste the content below into nano, save with Ctrl+X, Y, Enter.
```yaml
services:
  # First node
  pve-1:
    image: ghcr.io/longqt-sea/proxmox-ve
    container_name: pve-1
    hostname: pve-1
    privileged: true
    restart: unless-stopped
    cgroup: host
    networks:
      - dual_stack
    
    # Port mapping only required for Docker Desktop or LAN access from other machines.
    # On Linux host, you can access this node directly via hostname or IP address, e.g. https://pve-1:8006 or https://[fd00::1]:8006
    ports:

      - "3128:3128"

      - ./ISOs:/var/lib/vz/template/iso  # Replace ./ISOs with the path to your ISO folder


  # Third node
  pve-3:

    # On Linux host, you can access this node directly via hostname or IP address, e.g. https://pve-3:8006 or https://[fd00::3]:8006
    ports:
      - "2224:22"
      - "3130:3128"
      - "8008:8006"   # Third node Web GUI is listening on localhost:8008

      - /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup
      - /usr/lib/modules:/usr/lib/modules:ro
      - /sys/kernel/security:/sys/kernel/security
      - ./VM-Backup:/var/lib/vz/dump
      - ./ISOs:/var/lib/vz/template/iso  # Replace ./ISOs with the path to your ISO folder


  # Optional: Proxmox Datacenter Manager
  pdm:
    image: ghcr.io/longqt-sea/proxmox-datacenter-manager
    container_name: pdm
    hostname: pdm
    restart: unless-stopped
    cgroup: host
    security_opt:
      - seccomp=unconfined
      - apparmor=unconfined
    cap_add:
      - ALL
    volumes:
      - /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup
    networks:
      - dual_stack
    
    # Port mapping only required for Docker Desktop or LAN access from other machines.
    # On Linux host, you can access this container directly via hostname or IP address, e.g. https://pdm:8443 or https://[fd00::4]:8443
    ports:
      - "2225:22"
      - "8443:8443"

# Dual-stack network for this cluster
networks:
  dual_stack:
    enable_ipv6: true
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 10.0.99.0/24
          gateway: 10.0.99.99
        - subnet: fd00::/64
          gateway: fd00::99
```
Bring it up:
```
docker compose up -d
```
Set root password for all nodes:
```
docker exec -it pve-1 passwd
docker exec -it pve-2 passwd
docker exec -it pve-3 passwd
```
Restart all nodes at least once:
```
docker restart -t 5 pve-1 pve-2 pve-3
```

Nodes can reach each other over hostname or IP address:
| hostname | IPv4       | IPv6    |
|----------|------------|---------|
| pve-1    | 10.0.99.1  | fd00::1 |
| pve-2    | 10.0.99.2  | fd00::2 |
| pve-3    | 10.0.99.3  | fd00::3 |
| pdm      | 10.0.99.4  | fd00::4 |

To tear down the cluster:
```
docker compose down -t 0
```

## Ports

| Port | Purpose |
|------|--------------|
| 8006 | Web UI |
| 3128 | SPICE proxy |
| 22 | SSH |
| 8443 | PDM Web UI |

## Volumes

| Host Path | Container Path | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| ./VM-Backup | /var/lib/vz/dump | VM backups |
| ./ISOs | /var/lib/vz/template/iso | ISO images |

## Networks

- `vmbr1` - NAT network for VM and LXC, works out of the box
- `vmbr2` - Empty bridge, configure it yourself, maybe with macvlan, veth or passthrough a physical NIC

---

> [!Note]
> When running with `podman`, make sure to run as root or with `sudo`, rootless Podman does not work even with `--privileged`.

> [!Warning]
> This setup uses the `--privileged` flag. The container can do almost everything the Linux host can do. Use with caution.
